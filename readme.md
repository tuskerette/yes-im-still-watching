# yes i'm still watching

## Setup

1) Open Terminal, cd into this folder.
2) Make sure you have `http-server` [installed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
for example `npm install --global http-server`
or `brew install http-server`
Run it on port 5002
`http-server -p5002`

Or use a ruby dummy server
`ruby -run -ehttpd . -p5002`

3) Go to `http://localhost:5002`
4) Drag the link to your bookmarks bar in Chrome.
5) EVENTUALLY* It should work and click yes to the dialog "Are you still watching?"


(*) have something observe the DOM, when the popup appears, trigger the click to select the "Yes" button.
